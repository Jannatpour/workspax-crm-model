## Tips for Effective AI Use

### Be Specific with Instructions

The more specific your instructions, the better the AI can help you. For example, instead of asking for "an email," specify "a follow-up email to a prospect who hasn't responded in two weeks, mentioning our new feature release."

### Review and Edit AI Content

Always review and edit AI-generated content before using it. While the AI is powerful, your human touch ensures the content matches your voice and needs.

### Provide Feedback

Use the thumbs up/down buttons after each AI interaction to help improve future responses. You can also provide specific feedback in the comments field.

### Combine Multiple AI Functions

For best results, combine different AI capabilities. For example, after qualifying a lead, use the AI to research their company, then generate a personalized email, and finally create a follow-up sequence.

### Start Simple

If you're new to AI assistants, start with simple tasks like email generation or lead qualification before moving to more complex workflows.

## Troubleshooting
